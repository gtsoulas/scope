\title{Response to the second reviewer's comments}
\author{this is the review starting \textit{For example}}
\date{\today}

\maketitle
  The reviewer makes a number of small points that have been dealt with.  One point that we have not discussed is the idea that there e is a problem because the scope of indefinites seems to be insensitive to islands.  This is a vast topic but the semantic literature contains a number of proposals stemming from Kamp's and Heim's work that is aimed to account for this.  Specifically Abusch(1994) shows that the behaviour of indefinites is different from that of quantifiers is many respects.  As a result, any of these proposal would be appropriate here.  Discussing this topic in the present context would really take us too far afield.
The second comment regards the status of LF movement.  We have discussed this in more detail in the paper and show that the notion of ``LF-movement'' is in itself unformulable under current theoretical assumptions and even if it was it does not produce what one would like it to.
