\section{Introduction}

\ex.\label{intro10}\a.XP {\dots} $\langle$\textst{XP}$\rangle$ $\qquad$ (moved construction)
    \b.$\langle$\textst{XP}$\rangle$ {\dots} XP $\qquad$ (in-situ construction)

A consequence of the schema in \ref{intro10} is that the variation between an ex-situ vs. in-situ configuration is reduced to an issue of which copy is spelled out.  Determining which copy is spelled out is a matter of scope assignemnt. Two of the most common phenomena to be associated with this is that of certain wh-in-situ constructions and Quantifier Raising (QR).

In this paper, we argue that LF-movement in both wh-in-situ and QR can eliminated in favour of SSO and the judicious application of unselective binding. As mentioned, SSO already comes for free by the copy theory, while unselective binding already exists as one of the core tools used in explaining certain issues at the syntax--semantics interface; our approach, therefore, is a parsimonious step forward in reducing the existing pool of syntactic operations rather than replacing one with another, or adding a new operation.

The structure of this paper is as follows: in section 2, we overview the landscape of wh-typology and highlight the parameters necessary to unify the wide range of cross-linguistic variation we find in wh-constructions; in section 3, we show how an SSO approach allows us to explain the variation by
formulating a typology expressed in terms of SSO parameters; section 4 addresses the issue of QR and explores the slightly counterintuitive idea that an LF-movement approach to QR can be reformulated in terms of unselective binding of quantifiers by scope-marking operators; section 5 highlights the many remaining issues and presents suggestions for future directions of work, and section 6 concludes.

\section{Wh-Movement and wh-scope}
\subsection{The independence of clause typing and wh-scope fixing}
It is well known that languages vary in terms of whether they are wh-movement or wh-in-situ languages (and in some cases in-between). The claim here is that at least some cases of this variation reflect a purely surface phenomenon; that is, some wh-in-situ languages are, in fact, wh-movement languages, and that what varies is which wh-copy is spelled-out. Let us consider first the question as to what wh-movement actually does:

\ex.\label{wh.10}\a.\label{2.10a}What$_i$ did [John buy $t_i$]?
	\b.\label{2.10b}[John bought a book].

Wh-movement, in a sense, is the syntactic and semantic equivalent of bilocation because some part of the meaning of a wh-phrase needs to be interpreted in two places at once. A common assumption among scholars is that a wh-phrase in a wh-movement language is an operator, i.e. it expresses existential quantification. As such, it is necessary for the wh-phrase to move to a position in the clausal periphery such that it scopes over the entire proposition including the moved subject---this is why wh-movement involves movement to a position in the CP-layer, which is higher than the subject, which has moved to [Spec,TP]. At the same time, because the wh-phrase is also the argument of the verb, it must be interpreted as such in the base position from which it moves. Syntactic displacement, therefore, gives rise to semantic displacement.

Moving the wh-phrase leaves a trace (or a copy) that is interpreted as a variable.\footnote{This raises a non-trivial issue: if links of movement chain are copies, why should the wh-phrase be interpreted as an operator at the top of the chain while it is interpreted as a variable at the bottom of the chain.} Wh-movement is necessary in order for the moved wh-phrase to bind the trace variable resulting in existential quantification:

\ex.\label{wh.20}$\exists x_{wh}[\dots x_{wh}\ \dots]$

The expression in \ref{wh.20}, however, is still not the meaning of a question. Given our theory of syntax, wh-movement also requires a syntactic trigger that is usually expressed in terms of an interrogative C: a functional head that encodes interrogative clausal force, or ``clause type'' in the sense of Cheng (1997). In semantic terms, this results in $\lambda$-abstraction over the existentially quantified proposition:

\ex.\label{wh.30}$\lambda x_{wh}. [\dots x_{wh}\ \dots]$

This straightforwardly follows from approaches to question semantics as involving a set of propositions (Hamblin 1973; Karttunnen 1977). Such an approach is also compatible with well-known cases of languages that have wh-indefinites: wh-words that are interpreted existentially in declarative contexts. This follows straightforwardly from \ref{wh.20} and \ref{wh.30}---the lack of interrogative C precludes the availability of $\lambda$-abstraction as in \ref{wh.30}, resulting in a declarative, existentially quantified proposition in \ref{wh.20} (via Existential closure), which is essentially a wh-indefinite construction. The upshot is that all languages, regardless of the syntactic means by which they derive a wh-construction, must converge on the question meaning expressed in \ref{wh.30}.

Apart from interrogative C and the wh-phrase, it is becoming increasingly common to assume that a third player is involved in question formation. The empirical motivation for this is that in many languages, questions are formed using a Q(uestion) particle, and in the early days of GB and Minimalism, it was common to assume that Q was the realisation of an interrogative C head. However, from Watanabe (1992) to Hagstrom (1998), more recent (Cable 2007, Slade 2011, Yeo 2010) analyses posit that Q is distinct from interrogative to C, and that there are, in fact, three required elements in question formation: the wh-phrase, Q, and interrogative C.

Empirically, we find that the position of the wh-phrase and Q can vary along at least two dimensions:\footnote{There are other potential dimensions of variation that we do not discuss here. One is the headedness of the QP in languages that have clear QP constituents, e.g. Sinhala, Tlingit; another is the landing site of wh-movement, e.g. movement to Force vs. Focus position.} first, the particle can occur in a clause-initial, clause-final or in a position that is adjacent to the wh-word (the wh-word and Q form a constituent); second, the wh-phrase can occur in a clause-initial (wh-movement) or base argumental position (wh-in-situ). For expository purposes, we will postpone discussion of optional wh-movement and partial wh-movement cases to section 3.

The broad typological distribution is as follows. Wh-movement languages that have initial, wh-adjacent and final particles are exemplified by Hopi, Tlingit and Vata, respectively:


\exg.\label{wh.50}ya haki-y {\textraiseglotstop\textbari}m w{\textbari}va{\textraiseglotstop}ta \\
  Q who-\textsc{obl} you hit \\
  \trans{`Who did you hit?'}\hspace{\fill}[Hopi, \cite{jeanne:1978}]

\exg.\label{wh.60}daa s\'a k\'eet a\underline{x}\'a \\
  what Q killerwhale he.eats.it \\
  \trans{`What do killerwhales eat?'}\hspace{\fill}[Tlingit, \cite{cable:2007}]

\exg.\label{wh.70}\`al\'O$_i$ \`n n{\textvbaraccent{I}} [z\={E}$_j$ [\`a ny{\textvbaraccent{E}}-{\textroundcap{b}\textvbaraccent{O}} $t_i$ $t_j$]] y\`i l\`a\\
  who you \textsc{neg-aux} thing we gave-\textsc{rel} {} {} know Q \\
  \trans{`To whom don't you know what we have given?'}\hspace{\fill}[Vata, \cite{koopman:1984}]

Likewise for wh-in-situ languages, we find initial, wh-adjacent and final particles in Tumbuka, Sinahla and Japanese, respectively:

\exg.\label{wh.80}kasi Su\v{z}o a-ka-p\textsuperscript{h}ik-a vi\v{c}i \\
  Q Su\v{z}o \textsc{sm-pst}-cook-\textsc{fv} what \\
  \trans{`What did Su\v{z}o cook?'}\hspace{\fill}[Tumbuka, \cite{kimper:2006}]

\exg.\label{wh.90}Sunil mon{\textschwa}wa {d\textschwa} kieuwe \\
  Sunil what Q read.\textsc{pst.e} \\
  \trans{`What did Sunil read?'}\hspace{\fill}[Sinahala, \cite{slade:2011}]

\exg.\label{wh.100}John-ga nani-o nomimasita ka \\
  John-\textsc{nom} what-\textsc{acc} drank Q \\
  \trans{`What did John drink?'}\hspace{\fill}[Japanese, \cite{hagstrom:1998}]

If it is true that all questions must essentially converge on the same meaning, as shown in \ref{wh.30}, then the null hypothesis should be that all the relevant features interpretable at the interface which give rise to question meaning should be equally present in all of the above examples. Of course, other morphosyntactic properties such as case and agreement etc. can vary, but the core features responsible for question meaning (C, Q, wh, and perhaps focus) should not.

What this means for the syntax is that following the Clausal Typing Hypothesis in \cite{cheng:1997},\footnote{In this paper, we agree with Cheng in saying that clauses must be typed. We think that to the extent that there is one, clause typing is the immutable syntactic universal that relates to question formation, regardless of the syntactic framework one chooses to adopt. We do not, however, subscribe to the specific predictions that the clausal typing hypothesis makes with respect to the strict connection between wh-in-situ and the availability of question particles. See \cite{bruening:2007} for more substantial argumentation on this point.} clauses must be typed. We take this two mean only one thing, namely that that some clause must be specified as being an interrogative (as opposed to say, a declarative) by the merging of an interrogative C in the clause. The central claim here is that clause typing itself is not contingent on anything else, e.g. wh-movement or the presence of a question particle. The clearest place to find evidence of this would be take a slight detour to consider polar questions. The World Atlas of Language Structures Online (WALS) has a chapter (Ch. 116) on polar questions \citep{wals116:2013}, which shows that there are 173 languages that distinguish polar questions (only) by interrogative intonation, and 1 language (Chalcantongo Mixtec) that has no interrogative-declarative distinction. Consider the following minimal example from Kayardild (with the gloss slightly modified for consistency), an Australian Tangkic language,\footnote{According to WALS, Kayardild is listed as only using interrogative intonation, but this is inaccurate. \cite{evans:1995}, from which the Kayardild data is drawn, shows that polar questions can be formed with or without an initial question particle. This does not change our main point that other than interrogative C, no other syntactic device is necessary for clause typing.} which allows the formation of polar questions with only the use of question intonation but also optionally allows the use of a particle.

\ex.\ag.\label{wh.101a}nyingka marri-j?\\
   \textsc{2sg.nom} hear-\textsc{actual}\\
   \trans{`Do you understand?'}
   \bg.\label{wh.101b}kara nyingka marri-j?\\
   Q \textsc{2sg.nom} hear-\textsc{actual}\\
   \trans{`Can you understand?'}\hspace{\fill}\citep[364--365]{evans:1995}

Evans states: ``[polar questions] are formally identical with declaratives, except for a rising intonation conout centered on the questions word''. It is most plausible to assume that the ``questioned word'' in the examples here is \textit{marri-j} `hear', located at the end of the question, but note that the question particle \textit{kara} in \ref{wh.101b} is in an initial position. One approach would be to say that the question intonation is a PF-exponent of interrogative C, which is necessary in both \ref{wh.101a} and \ref{wh.101b}. It follows that the particle cannot be necessary. The other approach would be to say that the particle is interrogative C and the question intonation simply a PF-phenomenon. In which case, \ref{wh.101a} must involve a null version of \textit{kara}. Either approach reduces to requiring only interrogative C for clause typing.

A wh-question differs in that there is an additional wh-phrase that needs accounting for. However, if we extend the reasoning for polar questions to wh-questions, then we can say that like polar questions, wh-questions only require an interrogative C to clause type, but independently require something else to handle the wh-phrase -- specifically, there must be some mechanism by which the wh-phrase is made to scope over the relevant clause for reasons stated at the beginning of this section. This is not up for debate, we think, because without a wh-scoping mechanism, the direct vs. indirect question distinction cannot be derived.

Incidentally, in wh-movement languages, these two properties collapse into a single cluster of operations because interrogative C also triggers the movement of the wh-phrase into [Spec,CP], which gave rise to the (mis)understanding of wh-movement as the mechanism for clause typing. However, recall the central claim that only clause typing is universal, not wh-movement. This is in accord with our view that clause typing and scope fixing are independent mechanisms; it just so happens that in wh-movement, they obscure each other. This point is clearer in wh-in-situ languages, because without wh-movement to obscure scope fixing, we contend with the issue of semantic displacement -- that is, the meaning at which a wh-phrase should be interpreted does not correspond to the syntactic position at which it appears. Note that even in wh-in-situ questions, clause typing must still involve the presence of interrogative C. Among the syntactic analyses of wh-in-situ, what differs is whether a particular approach treats the question particle (if it exists) as a realisation of interrogative C or not.

Therefore, if scope fixing is always required, and if wh-movement is the dominant way by which wh-scope fixing is accomplished, it is desirable to recast wh-in-situ in terms of SSO of the wh-phrase because it is a step towards unification -- clause typing and scope fixing are the same in wh-movement and wh-in-situ languages; what varies is which wh-copy is spelled-out. This is in contrast with the traditional system of expressing the availability of wh-movement in terms of the the presence of an EPP on interrogative C, which is effectively superfluous variation in both syntax and PF, because under these approaches, one would need yet another mechanism for scope fixing.

\subsection{The empirical profile of SSO}
Since we are assuming a copy theory of movement and it is not a necessary condition for SSO to also exhibit overt morphosyntactic effects other than the pronunciation of a lower copy. Having said this, there three types of data that constitute compelling evidence for an SSO theory of wh-question formation. The first involves overt morphosyntactic effects that are linked to wh-movement but occurring in a wh-in-situ construction, which we find via wh-agreement phenomena in Chamorro and Coptic \citep{rlc:2006}. The second involves what appears to be truly optional wh-movement, even in multiclausal structures, in Babine-Witsuwit'en \citep{denham:1997,denham:2000}, which we see as straightforward SSO of the wh-phrase in different CP specifiers. The third involves partial wh-movement with scope markers (e.g. in German), which will ultimately reduce to a subtype of optional wh-movement and be evidence for that the particle Q must also be involved in the SSO paradigm.

Let us consider the basic wh-agreement facts in Chamorro first. In Chamorro, a wh-question is formed by applying wh-movement to a declarative VSO clause, resulting in an SVO or OVS word order accompanied by corresponding case agreement on the verb:

\exg.\label{wh.110}ha-bendi si Maria i kareta\\
   \textsc{agr}-sell {} Maria the car\\
   \trans{`Maria sold the car.'}

In order to form a wh-question, wh-movement is required and a corresponding agreement marker must appear on verb, which must agree in case with the moved wh-element:

\ex.\ag.\label{wh.120a}hayi b\textit{um}endi i kareta?\\
   who \textsc{wh}[nom].sell the car\\
   \trans{`Who sold the car?'}
   \bg.\label{wh.120b}hafa b\textit{in}inde-\textit{n\~na} si Maria?\\
   what \textsc{wh}[obj].sell-\textsc{agr} {} Maria\\
   \trans{`What did Maria sell?'}

A moved subject wh-phrase will trigger nominative case agreement on the verb, as shown by the \textit{-um-} marking on the verb in \ref{wh.120a}. A moved object wh-phrase will instead trigger objective case agreement \textit{-in-} on the verb and corresponding possessor agreement \textit{-n\~na}. A similar pattern is also found in relative clauses, which involve an overt relative complementiser but no overt relative pronoun:

\ex.\ag.\label{wh.130a}kao un-li'i' i palao'an [ni b\textit{um}endi i kareta]?\\
   Q \textsc{agr}-see the woman C$_{\textsc{rel}}$ \textsc{wh}[nom].sell the car\\
   \trans{`Did you see the woman who sold the car?'}
   \bg.\label{wh.130b}hu-fahan i kareta [ni b\textit{in}inde-\textit{n\~na} si Maria]\\
   \textsc{agr}-buy the car C$_{\textsc{rel}}$ \textsc{wh}[obj].sell {} Maria\\
   \trans{`I bought the car that Maria sold.'}

To sum up, Chamorro has overt wh-movement and corresponding wh-agreement, which surfaces as case agreement on the verb. Evidence of SSO would therefore involve behaviour that is similar to what happens in Chamorro without any overt signs of wh-movement. We turn now to Coptic Egyptian, which appears to show precisely this kind of behaviour.

Coptic Egyptian is predominantly wh-in-situ but crucially, when the wh-phrase is within a finite embedded clause, it does not take matrix scope and only an indirect question reading is possible:

\exg.\label{wh.140}aw{\textopeno} n-ti-sown an [t\v{s}e nt-a u \v{s}{\textopeno}pe mmo-s]\\
   and \textsc{neg(-pres)-1sg}-know not C \textsc{rel-perf} what happen to-\textsc{3sg:m}\\
   \trans{`And I don't know what happened to her.'}

The specific morphosyntactic effect that \cite{rlc:2006} claim to be wh-agreement is that of the relative tense marker. More specifically, the claim is that relative tense surfaces within the clause over which the wh-phrase takes scope. Consider a relative clause:

\exg.\label{wh.150}u-h{\textopeno\textbeta} [ere p-nute moste mmo-f]\\
   \textsc{indef:sg}-thing \textsc{rel(-pres)} \textsc{def:sg:m}-god hate DO-\textsc{3sg:m}\\
   \trans{`a thing that God hates'}

Like Chamorro, the formation of relative clauses in Coptic Egyptian does not make use of a relative pronoun but instead uses special wh-agreement morphology. In this case, it is the surfacing of relative tense. \cite{rlc:2006} take this to mean that like Chamorro, Coptic Egyptian relative clauses involve wh-movement of a null operator and by extension, the presence of wh-agreement suggests the presence of wh-movement. Additionally, Coptic Egyptian also allows wh-movement for focus reasons but when this happens, no wh-agreement is triggered:

\exg.\label{wh.160}e{\textbeta}ol t{\textopeno}n a-tet{\textschwa}-ei e-pei-ma?\\
   \textsc{pcl} where \textsc{perf-2pl}-come to-\textsc{dem:sg:m}-place\\
   \trans{`From where did you come here?'}

Conversely, when the wh-phrase does not move, relative tense surfaces:

\exg.\label{wh.170}e-r-{\textbeta\textepsilon}k e-t{\textopeno}n?\\
   \textsc{rel(-pres)-2sg:f}-go to-where\\
   \trans{`Where are you (woman) going?'}

Finally, when a wh-in-situ in an embedded clause is to be interpreted with matrix scope, relative tense surfaces in the matrix clause:

\exg.\label{wh.180}eye {\textschwa}nt{\textopeno}nt{\textschwa}n e-tet{\textschwa}n-t\v{s}{\textopeno} {\textschwa}mmo-s ero-i [t\v{s}e ang nim]?\\
   Q you(\textsc{-pl}) \textsc{rel(-pres)-2pl}-say DO-\textsc{3sg:f} about-\textsc{1sg} C I who\\
   \trans{`Who are you saying of me that I (am)?'}

\cite{rlc:2006} explain this distribution in terms of a similarity to a Doubly Filled Comp Filter effect \citep{chomsky-lasnik:1977} because in all cases, they argue, wh-movement takes place, but relative tense can only be pronounced when the lower copy -- but not the higher copy -- is spelled out. In sum, this is evidence for SSO of wh-phrases. They also further discuss participle agreement in relative clauses in Passamaquoddy, drawing from work done by \cite{bruening:2001}, which we do not include here for reasons for space. Instead, we turn now to Babine-Witsuwit'en, which exhibits a more straightforward effect of SSO.

\cite{denham:1997,denham:2000} describes Babine-Witsuwit'en, an Athabaskan language, as allowing truly optional wh-movement, with no variation in morphosyntactic shape or discourse effects. The movement is also argued not to be focalisation, topicalisation or clefting, while obeying island extraction constraints as would be expected of overt movement. Compared to Chamorro or Coptic Egyptian, the facts in Babine-Witsuwit-en are very straightforward: wh-phrases can remain in its base position or move to and stop at any Spec,CP position just as long as there is no wh-movement across an island. This can be clearly seen in the following:

\ex.\ag.\label{wh.190a}George [Lillian nd\"itn\"i book yik'iyelhdic] yilhn\"i?\\
   George Lillian which book \textsc{3sg}.read.\textsc{opt.3sg} \textsc{3sg}.told.\textsc{3sg}\\
   \bg.\label{wh.190b}George [nd\"itn\"i book Lillian yik'iyelhdic] yilhn\"i?\\
   George which book Lillian \textsc{3sg}.read.\textsc{opt.3sg} \textsc{3sg}.told.\textsc{3sg}\\
   \bg.\label{wh.190c}nd\"itn\"i book George [Lillian yik'iyelhdic] yilhn\"i?\\
   which book George Lillian \textsc{3sg}.read.\textsc{opt.3sg} \textsc{3sg}.told.\textsc{3sg}\\
   \trans{`Which book did George tell Lillian to read?'}

One question that will immediately arise is whether Babine-Witsuwit'en allows scrambling. It does not -- non-wh NPs do not have the freedom of moving, perhaps because of a lack of case marking on NPs:

\ex.\ag.\label{wh.200a}Lillian dus yunk\"et\\
   Lillian cat \textsc{3sg.bought.3sg}\\
   \trans{`Lillian bought a cat.'}
   \bg.*\label{wh.200b}Dus Lillian yunk\"et\\
   cat Lillian \textsc{3sg.bought.3sg}\\
   \trans{Intended meaning: `Lillian bought a cat.'}

As shown above in \ref{wh.200b}, the object cannot be fronted, and \ref{wh.200b} can only have the meaning that the cat bought Lillian. NPs can be fronted if focused, which requires the use of focus marker, which is notably absent in wh-constructions:

\exg.\label{wh.210}George 'en Lillian yunt'iy'\\
   George \textsc{foc} Lillian \textsc{3sg.likes.3sg}\\
   \trans{`It's George that Lillian likes.'}
   \trans{`It's George that likes Lillian.'}

Finally, wh-phrases are subject to island constraints. As can be seen in the examples below, extraction is impossible from sentential subjects \ref{wh.220} and coordinate structures \ref{wh.230}:

\ex.\label{wh.220}\ag.{}[George mb\"i yud\"ihye] Lillian yilhggi\"i?\\
   George who \textsc{3sg}.know.\textsc{3sg} Lillian \textsc{3sg}.surprised.\textsc{3sg}\\
   \trans{`That George knows who surprised Lillian?'}
   \bg.*mb\"i [George yud\"ihye] Lillian yilhggi\"i?\\
   who George \textsc{3sg}.know.\textsc{3sg} Lillian \textsc{3sg}.surprised.\textsc{3sg}\\

\ex.\label{wh.230}\ag.{}[George tl'ah mb\"i] hib\"in'\"e'n?\\
   George and who \textsc{2sg}.saw.\textsc{3pl}\\
   \trans{`You saw George and who?'}
   \bg.*mb\"i [George tl'ah] hib\"in'\"e'n?\\
   who George and \textsc{2sg}.saw.\textsc{3pl}\\

Denham takes this as evidence that wh-movement in Babine-Witsuwit'en, if it does occur, is overt wh-movement, and the optionality that follows is true optionality in terms of where the wh-phrase moves to. As mentioned in section 2.1, this is a classic problem of wh-scope fixing. If the wh-phrase is not pronounced at the position at which it should take scope (matrix in all the examples here), then there needs to be some mechanism by which scope can be fixed. Denham's solution to the problem involves proposing an extra projection above C, the Ty(pe)P, which is responsible for clause typing and scope. TyP is always projected where scope needs to be marked. In direct questions, TyP is projected above the matrix CP, which hosts an operator that binds the wh-phrase. Crucially, optional wh-movement is couched in terms of whether a C is projected or not, with the wh-phrase moving to wherever C is projected. If no C is projected, the wh-phrase remains in-situ, if only embedded C is projected, there is (partial) wh- movement to embedded [Spec,CP], and if matrix C is projected, there is full wh-fronting. Schematically, the solution (simplified to remove Agr projections) is formulated as follows:

\ex.\a.\label{wh.240a}wh-in-situ $=$ \ref{wh.190a}\\{}[$_{\textsc{TyP}}$ Op$_i$ [$_{\textsc{TP1}}$ \dots [$_{\textsc{vP}}$ \dots [$_{\textsc{TP2}}$ \dots [$_{\textsc{vP}}$ wh$_i$ ]]]]]\hspace{\fill}
   \b.\label{wh.240b}partial wh-movement $=$ \ref{wh.190b}\\{}[$_{\textsc{TyP}}$ Op$_i$ [$_{\textsc{TP1}}$ \dots [$_{\textsc{vP}}$ \dots [$_{\textsc{CP}}$ wh$_i$ \dots [$_{\textsc{TP2}}$ \dots [$_{\textsc{vP}}$ $t_i$ ]]]]]]\hspace{\fill}
   \b.\label{wh.240c}wh-fronting $=$ \ref{wh.190c}\\{}[$_{\textsc{TyP}}$ Op$_i$ [$_{\textsc{CP}}$ wh$_i$ \dots [$_{\textsc{TP1}}$ \dots [$_{\textsc{vP}}$ \dots [$_{\textsc{TP2}}$ \dots [$_{\textsc{vP}}$ $t_i$ ]]]]]]\hspace{\fill}\hspace{\fill}

We will not adopt this analysis; rather we claim that optional wh-movement of this sort is an exemplar for SSO. The analysis that we will propose in section 3 will be expressed in terms of a syntactic unity among all three constructions with wh-movement to the highest [Spec,CP] in all cases for wh-scope reasons. What differs is where the wh-phrase is spelled-out, which can only be links in the wh-movement chain. Typologically, languages differ in terms of what is allowed to spell-out where, while some languages allow several options, hence SSO.

The third type of construction we will consider is partial wh-movement with scope marking. Partial wh-movement is similar to what we find in Babine-Witsuwit'en, specifically when the wh-phrase moves to, and appears to stop at an intermediate [Spec,CP] with the corresponding surfacing of a marker at the scope marking position (usually matrix). This scope marker can take the form of a wh-word or a particle. \cite{fanselow:2006} provides a very detailed overview of the cross-linguistic profile of partial wh-movement shows the following examples from German and Albanian (citing \citealp{turano:1995}):

\ex.\label{wh.250}\ag.\label{wh.250a}was glaubst du wen Irina $t$ liebt?\\
   what believe you who-\textsc{acc} Irina {} loves\\
   \trans{`Who do you believe that Irina loves?'}
   \bg.\label{wh.250b}was glaubst du was er sagt wen Irina liebt?\\
   what believe you what he says who Irina loves\\
   \trans{`Who do you believe that he says that Irina loves?'}

\ex.\label{wh.260}\ag.\label{wh.260a}a mendon se Maria thot\"e se \c{c}far\"e ka sjell\"e burri?\\
   Q think that Mary says that what brought her husband\\
   \trans{`What do you think that Maria says that her husband brought?'}
   \bg.\label{wh.260b}a mendon se \c{c}far\"e thot\"e Maria se ka sjell\"e burri?\\
   Q think that what says Mary that brought her husband\\
   \trans{`What do you think that Maria says that her husband brought?'}

In German \ref{wh.250}, we see that \textit{was} `what' is used to mark scope, while the wh-word stays low in the embedded clause. In Albanian \ref{wh.260}, we see the question particle \textit{a} marking matrix scope, while the wh-phrase \textit{\c{c}far\"e} `what' stays low. We will not go through the specifics of each language (although see \citealp{fanselow-cavar:2000} for a detailed account of German), but the main point is that these constructions are amenable to a SSO account of wh-constructions. Specifically, we claim that that the scope marker can be viewed as the instantiation of the Q-particle, while the lower wh-phrase corresponds to the argumental wh-phrase. If we merge this line of thinking with the notion that a question particle forms a constituent with the wh-phrase that it associates with, then a theory of SSO extends to not only the spell-out position of the wh-phrase, but also that of the Q-particle. By varying the positions of where Q and the wh-phrase are spelled-out, along with whether or not Q is phonetically overt, we can unify the constructions that we have seen in this section: we can express a typology that describes the positions of both the wh-phrase and Q-particle we observed in \ref{wh.50}--\ref{wh.100}; we can account for the optional wh-movement case in Babine-Witsuwit'en, and we can describe the partial wh-movement and scope-marking constructions that we have just observed. We turn to this presently.

\section{SSO and the interaction of C, Q, and wh}
\subsection{Theoretical preliminaries}
In section 2, we asserted that the only requirement for the clause typing of an interrogative is the presence of an interrogative C. The effect that C has at the interfaces is basically that of a set-former: it takes a proposition and turns it into a set of propositions, which corresponds to the denotation of a question. The function of wh-movement is to fix scope, and in languages that have wh-movement, interrogative C also triggers the movement of the wh-phrase to [Spec,CP], which gives rise to a matrix scope direct question. We further observed that in wh-in-situ languages, or languages that permit optional or partial wh-movement, the wh-phrase is not located in a position at which it takes scope, and there must be a separate mechanism by which this occurs, e.g. through the use of a scope marking element or the positing of an abstract typing head in the clausal periphery. Taken at face value, one might entertain the idea that languages are parameterised in terms of whether wh-movement is used for scope fixing or not, in which case a scope marker is present. The analysis that we are proposing here is that universally, the formation of wh-questions requires not just interrogative C and the wh-phrase but also the Q-particle. What varies crosslinguistically are the relative positions of the wh-phrase and Q, as well as the form that the Q-particle takes, it could be overt or null; it could be a wh-word or it could be an independent morpheme. Such an approach as been especially espoused by \cite{hagstrom:1998}, \cite{cable:2007} and \cite{slade:2011}, who develop a detailed and formal account of the syntactic and semantic properties of Q. The specifics of each approach vary, but they converge more or less along the lines of the theoretical treatment of Q as a (variable over) choice functions. A choice function is a function that picks a member from a set of elements, and if the wh-phrase is seen as a set of entities (people for `who', things for `what' etc.), then the combination of Q and a wh-phrase yields an individual, what is commonly known in the literature as a wh-indefinite. Roughly as follows:\footnote{While the basic fact that a choice function picks a member from set remains unchanged, specific analyses vary. \cite{cable:2007}, for example, treats Q itself as a variable over choice functions, which needs to be bound by existential closure to yield indefinites, so \ref{sso.10} would more accurately be $\exists f.f(wh)$, $f$ a choice function.}

\ex.\label{sso.10}\a.wh$' = \{a,b,c\}$
   \b.Q(wh) $= x: x \in \{a,b,c\}$
   
Empirically, Japanese \citep{hagstrom:1998} provides a very clear example of this:

\ex.\ag.\label{sso.20a}John-ga nani-ka-o katta\\
  John-\textsc{nom} what-Q-\textsc{acc} bought\\
  \trans{`John bought something.'}
  \bg.\label{sso.20b}John-ga nani-o kaimasita ka\\
  John-\textsc{nom} what-\textsc{acc} bought.\textsc{polite} Q\\
  \trans{`What did John buy?'}

In \ref{sso.20a}, \textit{nani-ka} `what-Q' is interpreted as an indefinite `something'. Crucially, since \ref{sso.20a} is a declarative, not a question, there is no interrogative C. However, \ref{sso.20b} is interpreted as a question and therefore has interrogative C. Japanese is a wh-in-situ language, and scope marking must therefore be accomplished through the use of the particle. Now, suppose that we say that \ref{sso.20b} is derived from \ref{sso.20a}, then it follows that the particle \textit{ka} has moved from a clause internal position to the periphery. Next, consider Sinhala (\cite{slade:2011}, citing \cite{gair-sumangala:1991} and \cite{hagstrom:1998}):

\ex.\ag.\label{sso.30a}mokak d{\textschwa} w{\ae}tuna\\
   what Q fell-A\\
   \trans{`Something fell.'}
   \bg.\label{sso.30b}mokak d{\textschwa} w{\ae}tune\\
   what Q fell-E\\
   \trans{`What fell?'}

Like Japanese, the Q-particle \textit{d\textschwa} in Sinhala is merged in a position adjacent to the wh-phrase to yield an indefinite, as in \ref{sso.30a}. However, unlike Japanese, when forming a question Sinhala does not resort to Q-movement to the periphery, which means that neither wh-movement nor Q-movement/marking can be responsible for fixing the scope of the wh-word. Instead, the verb ending \textit{-e} is responsible for marking the scope of the wh-phrase. \cite{slade:2011} analysis involves the observation that the \textit{-e} verbal marking in Sinhala is also responsible for focus, which then triggers head movement of the verb from V to I to Foc. If we follow \cite{rizzi:1997} in assuming that Focus is a head within the articulated CP layer, then this does not run counter to our claim that wh-questions are clause typed by interrogative C.\footnote{Although this is something that we cannot address in detail here, a non-trivial follow-up to this issue is to what extent wh-movement is driven by focus. As far back as \cite{huang:1982}, it has been observed that wh-movement and focus movement interact in intricate ways; more modern analyses \citep{beck:2006} suggest that the set of propositional alternatives in wh-questions are focus alternatives. Empirically, the facts are rather complex. For example, in Babine-Witsuwit'en, \cite{denham:2000} argues that wh-movement is not driven by focus, since there is a dedicated focus marker for overt elements that bear focus. For purposes of this paper, since we are primarily concerned with expressing a coherent system of interrogativity, with an emphasis on clause typing and scope marking, we will adopt the approach that wh-movement is driven by the need to satisfy the EPP on some C head, and intentionally blur the distinction between as to whether the C head is ``purely'' interrogative, e.g. Force, or interrogative by means of focus alternatives.}





The strongest claim possible is that all wh-movement and wh-in-situ are identical, with only SSO being a dimension of variation. This cannot be correct at face value without considering issues of arugment/adjunct asymmetry and variation with regards to extraction from islands, and so our goals here are more modest. We are claiming that non-trivial subset of wh-in-situ languages can be modelled along the lines of SSO, and motivations for unification are compelling enough to warrant serious inquiry in this area.

Other relevant issues regarding SSO:
\begin{itemize}
	\item overt wh-movement is subject to islands
    \item this entails that SSO is also subject to islands
    \item what to do in multiple wh-questions in English? Does the lower one move?
    \item LF-movement is not subject to islands = unselective binding
    \item This entails two types wh-in-situ: 1) SSO (wh inside islands NOT OK); 2) unselective binding (wh inside islands OK)
    \item Unselective binding split into two types: 1) base generation of scope marker in scope taking position (German partial wh-movement); 2) local generation of scope marker followed by movement to scope taking position (Q-movement)
\end{itemize}

Notes on QR:
\begin{itemize}
	\item QR can be recast as unselective binding by a scope operator
    \item Multiple quantifiers and ambiguous scope can be expressed as Absorption on the scope marker, i.e. Q$_{\forall>\exists}$ vs. Q$_{\exists>\forall}$
    \item Example of floating quantifiers as scope markers, floating all/each = generalised D-operator.
    \item Determiner quantifiers must QR $\lambda P\lambda Q.\forall x[P(x) \to Q(x)]$ because they take the NP as its first argument, and need to move to scope over the sentence.
    \item In our terms, determiner quantifiers must be bound by a scope marking operator, cf. Q binding wh-phrase (which is a DP), vs. Scope binding quantified DP -- there's a parallel to be made here.
    \item Floating quantifiers are generalised D-operators and don't need scope marking since they mark scope where they are, $\lambda Q\lambda P.\forall x[P(x) \to Q(x)]$, i.e. they take the VP as its first argument, i.e. they are not determiners
