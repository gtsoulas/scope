\title{Response to reviewer's comments}
\author{George Tsoulas \& Norman Yeo}
\date{\today}

\maketitle


The reviewer's insightful and helpful comments have allowed us to clarify a number of issues in the paper and have led to several major modifications in the presentation and argument.  We are pleased that we have been able to incorporate the vast majority of the comments that we received.  In the very few cases where we have not been able to do so is in cases where taking into account the reviewer's commentary would require inordinate lengthening of the paper.  More precisely:

\paragraph{Reviewer 3 (Starting: ``This is a well written paper'')}  We have followed the reviewer's suggestions and incorporated earlier discussions of the idea of differential spell-out.  We have limited ourselves to the areas where this was most relevant to the concerns of the paper.  the reviewer raises the issue of the connection that we make between the analysis of WH and the Beghelli and Stowell system for scope and suggests that it may be problematic in the framework of the paper that choice function  indefinites and Q-particles do not behave alike (especially that Q-particles do not behave as existential quantifiers).  This is correct but this is only because Q-particles are \textbf{not} existential quantifiers.  Although we are not taking an explicit stance, they are usually considered to be variables over choice functions which can be bound either by existential closure or an interrogative C.  If anything this behaviour supports our proposal since it underlines a parallel between choice function indefinites which can be ``bound'' at wide or narrow scope levels by closure operations (this is because the closure operation is not restricted).
the reviewer also asks why, under this account QR would be clause bound unlike Wh movement.  We have not incorporated a discussion of this point in the paper but the answer is rather obvious under our assumptions.  given that the effects of QR are subsumed under AGREE between a functional head and a DP it follows that QR will be restricted by the same locality constraints as AGREE.

\paragraph{Reviewer 2 (Starting ``For example''} 
\paragraph{Reviewer 1.  (Starting ``The paper argues'')}
